<p align="center">
  <b>Official Python library for the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP).</b>
</p>

## Overview

This repository contains the Python SDK for the
[Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)](https://ucp.dev). It provides Pydantic
models for UCP schemas, making it easy to build UCP-compliant applications
in Python.

## Installation

For now, you can install the SDK using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a directory for the SDK
mkdir sdk

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/python-sdk.git sdk/python

# Navigate to the directory
cd sdk/python

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

### Generating Pydantic Models

The models are automatically generated from the JSON schemas in the UCP
Specification.

To regenerate the models:

```bash
uv sync
./generate_models.sh
```

The generated code is automatically formatted using `ruff`.
